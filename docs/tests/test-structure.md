# Test Structure

## File Organization

Tests are organized in the following structure:

- `*.spec.ts` - Unit tests for individual components
- `*.e2e-spec.ts` - End-to-end tests

## Key Test Areas

### Authentication Tests

The authentication module includes comprehensive tests for:

- Login functionality
- Token refresh mechanism
- Password reset flow
- Google OAuth integration

### User Management Tests

User-related functionality is tested through:

- User creation and updates
- Role-based access control
- Permission management

### Email Service Tests

The email service is tested for:

- Email template rendering
- Email sending functionality
- Error handling

## Test Best Practices

1. Each test file should focus on a single component or service
2. Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
3. Mock external dependencies to ensure test isolation
4. Maintain test coverage above 90% for critical paths
5. Include both positive and negative test cases

## Mocking Strategy

The project uses Jest's mocking capabilities to:

- Mock external services (e.g., email service)
- Simulate database operations
- Test error scenarios
- Verify service interactions
